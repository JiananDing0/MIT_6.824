#### Reason of distributed systems:
* Parallelism between computers to get large job done.
* Higher fault tolenrance for those happens on some computers of the system.
* Isolated computers provide better security.

#### Main challenges:
* Concurrency problems among computers.
* Solutions for partial failures.
* Methods to get higher performance.

#### Terms:
* Scalability: the performance/throughput of the system can be imporved by adding more computers to it.
* Availability: the system is always available unless certain amount of failures happen.
* Recoverability: recover failures happen in the system. Such as restore the storage data by using non-volatile storage or replications.
* MapReduce: a distributed system framework that helps distributing work to all computers in the system.

#### Understanding of MapReduce
* Basic ideas:  
  - **MapReduce** is a programming model that:  
    * Processes a key/value pair to **generate** a set of intermediate key/value pairs. 
    * Use reduce function that **merges** all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.
  - How does it related to distributed system?  
    Programs written in MapReduce style will be automatically **parallelized** and **executed on a large cluster of commodity machines**. The run-time system takes care of the details of partitioning the input data, scheduling the programâ€™s execution across a set of machines, handling machine failures, and managing the required inter-machine communication.

* Avoid network communications in case that network throughput is limited.
