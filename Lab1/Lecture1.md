#### Reason of distributed systems:
* Parallelism between computers to get large job done.
* Higher fault tolenrance for those happens on some computers of the system.
* Isolated computers provide better security.

#### Main challenges:
* Concurrency problems among computers.
* Solutions for partial failures.
* Methods to get higher performance.

#### Terms:
* Scalability: the performance/throughput of the system can be imporved by adding more computers to it.
* Availability: the system is always available unless certain amount of failures happen.
* Recoverability: recover failures happen in the system. Such as restore the storage data by using non-volatile storage or replications.
* MapReduce: a distributed system framework that helps distributing work to all computers in the system.
